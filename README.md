This is a UI project built using ReactJS.

There are two views in the project: Add DNA Sequence and Sequence views.

The three input fields are validated and when all three input fields pass the validation tests, user is able to submit the DNA sample. The added DNA samples can be viewed in the Sequence view where the user is able to search for a specific DNA based on DNA name, sort the list according to DNA name and view each DNA sequence in a modal window.
